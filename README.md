# Final_project_fl


I’m going to implement flappy bird, an existing cell phone game.

Score
As the game progresses, that is, as long as the bird survives, the score continues to rise. Score = Time


Difficulty

As time goes on, the game speed increases in order to increase
 the difficulty. This will speed up the rate at which obstacles are created

As time goes on, I will increase the difficulty by changing the color of the obstacles and map to reduce the user’s concentration. (Like dinosaur game in chrome)
